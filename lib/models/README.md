# Code Generation

To generate the freezed and JSON serializable code, run the following command:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

Or for continuous watching and rebuilding:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

dart run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs
